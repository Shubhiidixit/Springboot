# Springboot

This is the practice repository for Spring Boot, a Java-based framework for building web applications. The code for this practice repository can be found in the `master` branch. 

## Introduction 

**Spring Boot** is an open-source Java-based framework used to create production-grade Spring-based applications with minimal setup. It simplifies the deployment and production readiness of your applications by providing a set of conventions and ready-to-use configurations.

Key features of Spring Boot include:

- **Auto Configuration:** Spring Boot automatically configures your application based on the dependencies you have in your project, reducing the need for manual setup.

- **Standalone:** Spring Boot applications can be run from the command line without needing an external application server.

- **Production Ready:** It provides built-in health checks, metrics, and externalized configuration for production-ready applications.

- **Microservices Ready:** Spring Boot is ideal for building microservices-based architectures due to its ease of setup and flexibility.
